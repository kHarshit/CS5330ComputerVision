# Project 5: Recognition using Deep Networks

In this project, we constructed and trained a neural network to perform digit recognition using the well-known MNIST dataset. Our primary goal was to leverage the power of deep learning techniques, particularly utilizing PyTorch, to develop a model capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits. Through a series of structured tasks, we aimed to build a robust network architecture, train it on the MNIST dataset, and evaluate its performance. Additionally, we delved into experimenting with different network configurations to understand their impact on model performance. We also visualized the filters of the convolutional layers to gain insights into the learned features. Finally, we created an AutoEncoder to compress and reconstruct the MNIST images, demonstrating the power of deep learning in image processing tasks.

## Usage

* For task 1: use main.py 
* For task 2: use weights.py
* For task 3: use greek.py and to predict handwritten greek letters pass the argument as:  
    python greek.py --mode=predict  (mode can be either train or predict)
* For task 4: use experiment.py
* For extension part 1: use experiment.py
* For extension part 2: use live_detect.py
* For extension part 3: use autoencoder.py
* For extension part4: use pretrained_weights.py

The models are in models/ and training functions in utils.py.
